The Beacon protocol defines an open standard for genomics data discovery, developed by members of the Global Alliance for Genomics & Health. It provides a framework for public web services responding to queries against genomic data collections, for instance from population based or disease specific genome repositories.

This repository contains the specification for the *v2* major version upgrade of the Beacon API. It is now (2020) under active development and has _not_ seen a _stable_ code release.

For further information, please follow the work here and consult the [Beacon Project website](http://bacon-project.io).
